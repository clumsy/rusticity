## Architecture

Inspired by Helix editor (https://github.com/helix-editor/helix), the project is split into:

- **rusticity-core**: Core AWS functionality (SDK clients, API calls, data models)
- **rusticity-term**: Terminal UI layer (event handling, keymaps, rendering, pane management)
- **rusticity**: Main application binary

## Installation

### From crates.io

```bash
cargo install rusticity
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clumsy/rusticity.git
cd rusticity
cargo install --path rusticity
```

## Configuration

Configure AWS credentials using standard AWS methods:

```bash
# Using environment variables
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=your-region
export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret

# Or use AWS CLI configuration
aws configure
```

### Column Customization

Customize column names by adding a `[columns]` section to `~/.config/rusticity/config.toml`:

```toml
[columns.lambda.function]
name = "Function Name"
description = "Description"

[columns.cw.group]
log_group = "Log Group"
stored_bytes = "Storage"
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the application
rusticity

# With specific AWS profile and region
AWS_PROFILE=your-profile AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=your-region rusticity
```

## Development

The project uses a Cargo workspace with three crates:

```
rusticity/
├── rusticity-core/    # Core AWS SDK integration
├── rusticity-term/    # Terminal UI components
└── rusticity/         # Main binary
```

### Setup

```bash
# Clone and build
cargo build

# Run tests (also installs git hooks automatically)
cargo test
```

Git hooks will automatically check formatting and linting before commits.

### Run

```bash
# Run the application
cargo run

# With specific AWS profile and region
AWS_PROFILE=your-profile AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=your-region cargo run
```

### Testing

`cargo test` runs all checks including formatting, linting, and tests:

```bash
cargo test  # Runs fmt check, clippy, and all tests
```
